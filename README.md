Iâ€™ve created an AI-powered Resume Evaluator that works like the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used by many companies. It reviews a resume against a specific job description, checks for relevant keywords, and provides a score along with suggestions for improvement. This helps applicants understand how well their resume matches the job and how they can make it more competitive.
